# X-is-for-Xavier

This is a child's book reated in 1972 by Jane Breen and Catherine Carney.  It was originally written as a Colorforms book where the animals
cover up part of the lyrics and the child moves the colorform animal to reveal each letter's answer.

This has been updated to be an IOS app along with custom music.

In order to fully compile the app, one needs to download the open source Musescore app.  It converts the custom sheet music into wav and caf files.

THis app is currently available on the app store but is no longer being kept current.
